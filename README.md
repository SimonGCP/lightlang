# LightLang
Are you tired of so called "best practices" when it comes to programming? Are your fingers tired from having to constantly type out long variable names? Do you wish you could just hack without having to worry about "readability" or "maintainability"?
Lightlang is the solution for you. 

## About Lightlang
Lightlang is an interpreted language where every variable and keyword is just one letter. That means that there are 26 possible keywords and variable names. If you need more, whatever you're doing
probabliy isn't worth doing anyway. This keeps the code simple and extremely fast to write. Faster than light, one might say.
